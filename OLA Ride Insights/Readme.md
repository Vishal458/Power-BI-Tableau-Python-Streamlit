Ola Ride Insights — Data-Driven Mobility Analytics 

Domain:
Ride-Sharing & Mobility Analytics 

Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze Ola ride booking data to 
understand: 
✔ ride demand 
✔ customer behaviour 
✔ cancellations 
✔ revenue trends 
✔ ratings & service quality 
and provide data-driven recommendations to improve business 
performance. 

Tools Used 
• SQL — Data extraction & queries 
• Python + Streamlit — Web analytics app 
• Power BI — Interactive dashboards 
• Pandas — Data preprocessing 

Dataset Description:
Each row represents one booking and includes: 
• Date & Time 
• Customer ID 
• Vehicle Type 
• Booking Status 
• Ride Distance 
• Payment Method 
• Driver Rating 
• Customer Rating 
• Cancellation Reason 
Dataset Size: ~103,000 rides 

2. Business Problem 
Ride-sharing companies like Ola operate at massive scale. 
But raw booking data alone cannot answer critical business 
questions like: 
❓ When is demand highest? 
❓ Which customers contribute most revenue? 
❓ Which vehicle type performs best? 
❓ Why do customers cancel rides? 
❓ Are drivers rated fairly? 
❓ Which payment method is preferred? 
This project transforms raw operational data into 
visual dashboards & insights to support business strategy.
